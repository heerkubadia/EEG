The goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing EEG signals to generate visual content, specifically focusing on images and videos. EEG signals provide a window into brain activity, and by decoding these signals, we aim to translate them into meaningful visual representations. This has potential applications in fields such as neurofeedback, brain-computer interfaces, and artistic expression.
